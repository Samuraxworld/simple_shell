.Nm
simple_shell is a simple implementation of the standard command interpreter for the system that receives comands from the standard input or a file. This version has many features that make it similar in some aspects to the standard shell, but it is
a simple program to learn its operation. Only some standard shell features have been incorporated. This manual page is not intended to be a tutorial or a full specification of 
.Nm

.Sh ARGUMENTS
The first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing 
.Nm
commands. The 
.Nm
reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. 
.Nm
's exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the 
.Nm 
searches the directories in PATH for the script.

.Sh BUILTING COMMANDS
.Pp                      \" Inserts a space
This is the list of builting commands with their descriptions:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Begins a tagged list
.It Fl cd                 \"-a flag as a list item
The cd command change the simple_shell working directory
.El                      \" Ends the list

.Sh COMPILATION

if the simple_shell still does not have an execution file, it is necessary to perform the compilation process from the .c files that host the source code, this process is recommended to do it with the GNU Compiler Collection and you must enter the following line:
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o simple_shell
.P
.RE
after the compilation process, your simple_shell should work like this in interactive mode, typing the following line followed by an ENTER::
.P
.RS
.B $ ./simple_shell
.P
.RE
But also in non-interactive mode:
.P
.RS
.B $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./simple_shell

.SH COMMANDS
The following commands are valid:

.IT
.B pwd
- prints the name of the current working directory

.B ls
- list the contents of the directory

.B echo
- shows a line of text

.B env
- display the environment variables and their values

Example of command:
.IP
.br
.\&
.RS
\&$ pwd
.br
\&/home/my_directory

\&$ echo "Hello World!"
.br
\&Hello World!
